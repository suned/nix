# nix

My personal nix related configuration.

Can be cloned directly into `~/.config`, but cloning into another folder and symlinking subfolders to `~/.config` is more recommended.

Uses direnv and nix-shell for managing dev dependencies.

## [nixpkgs](./nixpkgs)
Home manager configuration.

## [nix](./nix)
niv pins.
